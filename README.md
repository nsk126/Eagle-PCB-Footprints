# Eagle Footprints
I make some device footprints for PCBs in Eagle and you are free to use them.

Each device has it's own library but you can also get every device i've made using the mylibrary.lbr file.

## Current Devices (w/ Symbol and Footprint)

- TE Single Relay **1393277-4**
- TDK-Lambda Compact DC-DC Converter **CC10-1212SF-E**
- Hengwei PCB Relay **JQX-15F(T90)**
